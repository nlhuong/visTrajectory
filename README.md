# visTrajectory 

visTrajectory is a visualization tool built on `buds' R package.
buds maps high-dimensional data with an inherent ordering to latent 1D locations along an underlying gradient or trajectory. visTrajectory generates plots forrecovered 1D coordinates and their associated uncertainties as well as provides 2 and 3D usualizations of the trajectory.
